# Asteroids Reloaded

Author: Justin Kim

### The Project:
I will be using Cinder to create a recreation of the classic arcade game Asteroids, with some variations of my own

### Background:
I've always enjoyed a number of different classic arcade games and have always been interested in recreating some of my favorites. My first interest in programming in general stemmed from an interest in the creation of games, and although my interests have expanded since I feel that it would be fun to revisit the topic.

### Libraries to be Used:
* Cinder - https://libcinder.org/

### Tentative Timeline:
* Week 1 - Create base application, draw entities so that they appear on screen
* Week 2 - Entity movement along with collision detection between entities
* Week 3 - Complete application with game functionality

### Stretch Goals:
* Add a menu for better user interaction
* Add a 2 player mode
* Boss battles
