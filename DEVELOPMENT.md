 - **4/24/20** Set up base app; Tinkered with some views and view controllers.
    - Still need to properly set up views so they appear where they need to
    
 - **4/28/20** Fixed views such that they appear where they need to go.
    - Next steps: Add entities to appropriate views
   
 - **5/02/20** Entities added to views (ship).
    - Next steps: Entity movement, using arrow keys and natural movement
   
 - **5/03/20** Ship entity movement complete, controlled using arrow keys
    - Next steps: Add in other entities (bullets, asteroids)
